# Section 1: Introduction

## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It compiles your code into highly optimized JavaScript at build time, resulting in faster and smaller bundles for your web application.

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed classes for styling your web elements. You can compose styles by applying classes directly to your HTML elements, making it easy to create responsive and consistent designs.

## What is Daisy UI?

Daisy UI is an extension for Tailwind CSS that offers a collection of customizable UI components to streamline the process of building user interfaces. It provides ready-to-use components that work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.

# Section 2: Setting Up Your Project

In this section, we'll set up a new project and integrate Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and Daisy UI.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download them from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Step 1: Create a New Svelte Project

To create a new Svelte project, open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-tailwind-daisy
cd svelte-tailwind-daisy
npm install
```
## Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS

To install Tailwind CSS, run the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss
```

Next, generate a Tailwind CSS configuration file by running:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```
This will create a tailwind.config.js file in your project.

## Step 3: Install Daisy UI

Daisy UI can be added as a plugin to Tailwind CSS. Run the following command to install Daisy UI:

```bash
npm install daisyui
```
Now, you need to configure Tailwind CSS to use Daisy UI. Open your tailwind.config.js file and update it as follows:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ... (existing configuration)

  plugins: [require('daisyui')],
}
```

Your project is now set up with Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and Daisy UI. In the next section, we'll create a simple Svelte component and use Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI classes to style it.
